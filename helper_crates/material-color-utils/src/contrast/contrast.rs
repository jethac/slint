    // luminance may not contrast as desired, i.e. the contrast ratio of the
    // input color and the returned luminance may not reach the contrast ratio
    // asked for.
    //
    // When the desired contrast ratio and the result contrast ratio differ by
    // more than this amount, an error value should be returned, or the method
    // should be documented as 'unsafe', meaning, it will return a valid

    // Color spaces that measure luminance, such as Y in XYZ, L* in L*a*b*, or
    // T in HCT, are known as perceptually accurate color spaces.
    //
    // To be displayed, they must gamut map to a "display space", one that has
    // a defined limit on the number of colors. Display spaces include sRGB,
    // more commonly understood as RGB/HSL/HSV/HSB. Gamut mapping is undefined
    // and not defined by the color space. Any gamut mapping algorithm must
    // choose how to sacrifice accuracy in hue, saturation, and/or lightness.
    //
    // A principled solution is to maintain lightness, thus maintaining
    // contrast/a11y, maintain hue, thus maintaining aesthetic intent, and
    // reduce chroma until the color is in gamut.
    //
    // HCT chooses this solution, but, that doesn't mean it will _exactly_
    // match desired lightness, if only because RGB is quantized: RGB is
    // expressed as a set of integers: there may be an RGB color with, for
    // example, 47.892 lightness, but not 47.891.
    //
    // To allow for this inherent incompatibility between perceptually accurate
    // color spaces and display color spaces, methods that take a contrast
    // ratio and luminance, and return a luminance that reaches that contrast
    // ratio for the input luminance, purposefully darken/lighten their result
    // such that the desired contrast ratio will be reached even if inaccuracy
    // is introduced.
    //
    // 0.4 is generous, ex. HCT requires much less delta. It was chosen because
    // it provides a rough guarantee that as long as a perceptual color space
    // gamut maps lightness such that the resulting lightness rounds to the
    // same as the requested, the desired contrast ratio will be reached.
